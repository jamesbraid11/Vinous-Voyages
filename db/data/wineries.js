    about: 'Maison Delamotte was founded in 1760 by François Delamotte.  Influenced no doubt by his father-in-law, Antoine Bourgongne, a vine-grower in Aÿ who produced champagne under his own name, François decided to do the same. In 1760 established a House of Vins de Champagne (Wines of Champagne), in a building on the corner of rue Cérès and rue Marmousets, where he lived. The trade name Delamotte Père & Fils was adopted in 1786, when François’ elder son Alexandre joined forces with his father to help develop the now burgeoning family business. François also had another son, Nicolas Louis Delamotte, born in 1767 who was successful in business and influential in the wider trade, Nicolas Louis rose to become President of the Chamber of Commerce in Reims.',

    about: 'Château Cos d`Estournel is named after its 19th century owner, Louis-Gaspard d\'Estournel, and it was he who built the bizarre oriental edifice that is a landmark for any tourist in the Médoc. Today Cos d\'Estournel is without doubt the leading estate in St-Estéphe. It is located in the south of the appellation on the border with Pauillac and its vineyards are superbly sited on a south-facing gravel ridge with a high clay content, just north of Lafite. Cos d\'Estournel is typically a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc - do not be fooled by the relatively high Merlot content, as these are full-bodied, dark, brooding tannic wines when young which develop a complexity and intensity that can rival many top growths from Pauillac. In 1998 the Prats family sold Cos d\'Estournel to The Tailan Group. Cos d\'Estournel is classified as a 2ème Cru Classé.',

Soon afterwards it was awarded the status of "Feitoria", the highest vineyard classification of the age. Between 1758 and 1761, the Marquis of Pombal ordered the installation of 335 granite markers to denote the borders of the Douro Valley wine region – the first such demarcation in the world. One of these "marcos pombalinos" can still be seen at the estate today.

But his pioneering spirit led him to study winemaking in Bordeaux, which included a stint at Pomerol icon, Château Pétrus. In 1989, he joined forces with Rene Barbier to set up a winery in a neglected corner of Spain not then known for wine, Priorat. Using low yielding old-vines of Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cariñena grown on steep, slate hillsides, coupled with modern winemaking techniques, his ambition to create world-class wines was realised. He has grown the estate to include a range of both blended and single vineyard wines. Not content with his success in Priorat, he also set up Descendientes de J Palacios in Bierzo with his nephew, Ricardo Pérez, and reinvigorated the family holdings in Rioja.',

Starting off with one parcel of old goblet vines in the Vigneto Guardiola, Marco has now increased his holdings to numerous parcels including the Santo Spirito, Guardiola, San Lorenzo and Calderara vineyards. The principal variety grown on the estate is Nerello Mascalese, which is indigenous to the Etna. Its fabulous old bush vines, the majority of which are pre-Phylloxera, are planted on the rocky and sandy volcanic soils on the north face of Mount Etna at 800 to 900 metres above sea level. The wines are aged in barrels of varying sizes with a small proportion of new oak (rarely more than 20%) for 18 months. Unique, perfumed and spicy these are some of the region’s most complete and distinguished examples. Their floral aromas and lifted fruit coupled with gripping, structuring tannins means these are well balanced wines built to last.

One of the most esteemed winemaking families in France, they would lead the estate to the fame and respect it commands worldwide to this day. Core to this success has been an unwavering commitment to respecting the soil and the wider environment that contribute to this unique terroir. As such, the Perrin family have long been pioneers in sustainable viticulture, adopting organic farming in 1950 and biodynamics in 1974. The gnarled, old vines are planted in the traditional style referred to as \'gobelet\'. Of the 130 hectares at the estate, only 100ha are ever planted with vines, with the remaining 30ha allowed to rest and recover for at least a decade before being planted with vines once more. At harvest time, all of the grapes are handpicked and then sorted at the winery to ensure only the very best are vinified. In keeping with the winemaking traditions of the region, all 13 permitted varieties are used, each bringing its character, aroma and individuality to the final blend. The art of blending so many different varieties is a particular family secret, passed down from generation to generation.',

This stony soil, this terroir, reminded him of vineyards he had visited in France and Spain. The difficult ground would stress the grapevines, making them produce more mature, concentrated fruit. Christophe Baron had found a new home. The majority of the vineyard is planted with Syrah, and the rest dedicated to Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Merlot, Tempranillo and Viognier.
