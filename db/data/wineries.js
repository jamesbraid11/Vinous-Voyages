    about: 'Maison Delamotte was founded in 1760 by François Delamotte.  Influenced no doubt by his father-in-law, Antoine Bourgongne, a vine-grower in Aÿ who produced champagne under his own name, François decided to do the same. In 1760 established a House of Vins de Champagne (Wines of Champagne), in a building on the corner of rue Cérès and rue Marmousets, where he lived. The trade name Delamotte Père & Fils was adopted in 1786, when François’ elder son Alexandre joined forces with his father to help develop the now burgeoning family business. François also had another son, Nicolas Louis Delamotte, born in 1767 who was successful in business and influential in the wider trade, Nicolas Louis rose to become President of the Chamber of Commerce in Reims.',

    about: 'Château Cos d`Estournel is named after its 19th century owner, Louis-Gaspard d\'Estournel, and it was he who built the bizarre oriental edifice that is a landmark for any tourist in the Médoc. Today Cos d\'Estournel is without doubt the leading estate in St-Estéphe. It is located in the south of the appellation on the border with Pauillac and its vineyards are superbly sited on a south-facing gravel ridge with a high clay content, just north of Lafite. Cos d\'Estournel is typically a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc - do not be fooled by the relatively high Merlot content, as these are full-bodied, dark, brooding tannic wines when young which develop a complexity and intensity that can rival many top growths from Pauillac. In 1998 the Prats family sold Cos d\'Estournel to The Tailan Group. Cos d\'Estournel is classified as a 2ème Cru Classé.',

    about: 'Viña Montes is the shared vision of four friends, first dreamed up in the late 1980s, of making Chilean wines to a higher level than the world had ever seen. Now sold in more than 100 countries and noted as pioneers of high-end Chilean wine (Syrah, especially), Montes has undoubtedly achieved that goal. Perhaps it is the work of the angels that adorn the winery at every turn and, indeed, the wines’ labels – a superior presence that one of the founders felt alongside him, they add to the winery’s decidedly mystical air.',

    about: 'Perched high above the River Douro, between the towns of Régua and Pinhão, the site now occupied by Quinta do Crasto has been witness to the slow passage of time since at least the time of the Romans. Once a Roman "castrum" ("fort"), after which the estate was eventually named, the first record of wine being made here is in 1615. Soon afterwards it was awarded the status of "Feitoria", the highest vineyard classification of the age. Between 1758 and 1761, the Marquis of Pombal ordered the installation of 335 granite markers to denote the borders of the Douro Valley wine region – the first such demarcation in the world. One of these "marcos pombalinos" can still be seen at the estate today. The family of the current owners acquired this historic property over a century ago and has continued its long and venerable tradition of producing the highest possible quality Port wines.',

Dating back to 1715, it is the only historic Port shipper to bear the name of its vineyard (rather than gathering grapes from elsewhere), to produce single vineyard vintage Ports displaying the nuances of the land and, as of 1997, to have centralized all of its activities to the Douro Valley including bottling and storing its wines. To walk these magnificent terraced vineyards rising up from the riverbank is to touch upon the beating heart of the Douro, a UNESCO World Heritage site.',
