    about: 'Maison Delamotte was founded in 1760 by François Delamotte.  Influenced no doubt by his father-in-law, Antoine Bourgongne, a vine-grower in Aÿ who produced champagne under his own name, François decided to do the same. In 1760 established a House of Vins de Champagne (Wines of Champagne), in a building on the corner of rue Cérès and rue Marmousets, where he lived. The trade name Delamotte Père & Fils was adopted in 1786, when François’ elder son Alexandre joined forces with his father to help develop the now burgeoning family business. François also had another son, Nicolas Louis Delamotte, born in 1767 who was successful in business and influential in the wider trade, Nicolas Louis rose to become President of the Chamber of Commerce in Reims.',

    about: 'Known as NapaMedoc for the first three vintages and rebranded in 1982 as Opus One, this iconic Californian winery was founded as a joint venture between Baron Philippe de Rothschild of Château Mouton Rothschild and Robert Mondavi. The objective was to recreate a First Growth level, Bordeaux style wine in the Napa Valley and by every measure, they succeeded. The Grand Vin  is a blend of 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot and is aged for 18 months in 100% new French oak before being laid down for a further 18 months to mature in bottle. Since 1993, they have produced a second wine, Overture. The winemaker is Micheal Silacci who apprenticed under legendary Napa winemakers Andre Tchelistcheff and Warren Winiarski and previously held positions at Beaulieu Vineyard and Stag\'s Leap Wine Cellars.',

    about: 'Château Cos d`Estournel is named after its 19th century owner, Louis-Gaspard d\'Estournel, and it was he who built the bizarre oriental edifice that is a landmark for any tourist in the Médoc. Today Cos d\'Estournel is without doubt the leading estate in St-Estéphe. It is located in the south of the appellation on the border with Pauillac and its vineyards are superbly sited on a south-facing gravel ridge with a high clay content, just north of Lafite. Cos d\'Estournel is typically a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc - do not be fooled by the relatively high Merlot content, as these are full-bodied, dark, brooding tannic wines when young which develop a complexity and intensity that can rival many top growths from Pauillac. In 1998 the Prats family sold Cos d\'Estournel to The Tailan Group. Cos d\'Estournel is classified as a 2ème Cru Classé.',
